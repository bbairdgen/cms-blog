# cms-blog

## Description

This was a very valuable and learning project for me. I learned how to better apply handlebars, pass multiple models into a route, and create Put routes. I liked this project as it is a simpler version of a site that I want to build. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a CMS developed as a blog for tech posts. You can read any of the posts or comments on the site without an account. If you want to add posts or comments, you will need to create an account. You can create an account by clicking on "Login".
